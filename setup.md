How to set up FabricPool for use with an existing ONTAP system

FabricPool is a feature in NetApp's ONTAP storage operating system that allows you to tier less frequently accessed data(cold) to lower-cost object storages while keeping frequently accessed data(hot) to higher performing storages.

Configuring Cloud Tiering:
--------------------------

-   First, you need to confirm your cloud tiering license/third-party certificate. FabricPool requires a capacity-based license when attaching third-party object storage providers.

-   These certificates should be installed into ONTAP before attaching them for use with local tiers.

Considerations when Cloud Tiering:
----------------------------------

-   NOTE - Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, CA Certificates are not required. Regardless, using signed certificates from a third-party authority remains the best practice

-   Be aware of the different versions you are using because some might require specific permissions

-   FDQN - FabricPool stipulates that CA Certificates must have a fully qualified domain name as the cloud tier server with which they are connected

-   In releases prior to StorageGRID 11.3, the CA certificates use a common name that is not based on the FQDN. This might cause errors that prohibit StorageGRID from being attached to ONTAP local tiers.

-   Potential Errors - "Unable to add a cloud tier. Cannot verify the certificated provided by the object store server. The certificates might not be installed on the cluster."

-   In order to avoid these potential errors and successfully attach StorageGRID 11.2 or earlier releases as a cloud tier, you have to replace the certificates in the grid with certificates that use an accurate FQDN.

Installation:
-------------

-   Installation requires CA certificates. To install, first retrieve the CA Certificates and then install the certificates into ONTAP.

### How to Retrieve CA Certificates:

1.  Open the StorageGRID admin console > Select Configuration > Load Balancer Endpoints > Select your endpoint and click edit endpoint > copy the certificate PEM:
